##Introduction

 In recent years, several algorithms have been developed for mixed membership matrix factorization, but they only guarantee estimates from a local optimum. 
 Here, we derive a global optimization algorithm that provides a guaranteed 𝜖-global optimum for a sparse mixed membership matrix factorization problem. 
 We test the algorithm on simulated data and a small real gene expression dataset and find the algorithm always bounds the global optimum across random initializations and explores multiple modes efficiently.
